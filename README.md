# AI Ecosystem for Insurance Operations

## About

This repository presents an AI ecosystem that simulates the operations of an insurance organization. At its core is an intelligent AI agent that seamlessly coordinates with multiple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, each tailored to address specific use cases.

The system leverages state-of-the-art AI models and data processing pipelines to provide insightful responses based on a variety of documents, such as insurance policies, claims procedures, and HR guidelines. This allows for efficient querying, document retrieval, and answer generation across different insurance operations.

## Key Features

- AI Agent: A meta-agent that intelligently routes queries to the appropriate pipeline (e.g., HR, Claims, Reimbursement policies).
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipelines: These pipelines retrieve relevant information from indexed documents and generate answers using AI models like `Gemma2` and `Llama 3.3`.
- Document Management: The system supports PDFs containing various types of insurance documents, such as HR policies, claim policies, and reimbursement policies.
- Customization: Easy to extend with new document types or pipelines to suit additional insurance processes.
